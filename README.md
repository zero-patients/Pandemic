# Zero Patients

### What is Zero Patients?

Zero Patient is a clone of the board game Pandemic, with separate views for the board and the controller. The board is meant to be displayed on a central screen while players control their game pieces from a mobile device. The inspiration for this game, apart from the incredibly fun and engaging game of Pandemic, was Jackbox. We loved the idea of a game that you could just play in your living room with your friends, without having to worry about setup, missing game pieces, complicated game rules. Zero Patients takes care of all of that for you.
